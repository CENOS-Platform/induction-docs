These release notes are for the CENOS version 2018.x 

[**Release notes of CENOS v3.0**](/latest)

## v2018.7.5 (June 13, 2019)
* **Improved accuracy of template results**  
    Achieved by improving automatic mesh generation

## v2018.7.4 (June 12, 2019)
* **Multi-step scanning/moving**  
    Simulate multi-step processes, e.g., when inductor is moving forth and back, or it is standing still and moving afterwards. [**Read more**](/scanning-applications)

* **Time-dependent voltage**  
    It is possible to enter time-dependent voltage also in 3D simulations

* **Pre-filled template parameters**  
    When using template geometry, parameters are filled with the last known values 

* **Anonymized usage statistics**  
    In order to prioritize software improvements, CENOS collects simple usage statistics in fully anonymized way
    
* **Fixed filter for ParaView: Hardened profile 3D**

## v2018.7.3 (May 9, 2019)
* **NEW: Continue from the last time step**  
    It is possible to continue from the last known calculated time-step if simulation has finished or was stopped by user
  
* **Inconel is added to Material library**

* **Stranded coil**  
    Use stranded coil as domain type. [**Read more**](/stranded-coil)

* **Improved accuracy of energy economics**  
    This allows to calculate, e.g, inductance.

* **Improved adaptive time step**  
    Simulation time with adaptive time step is up to 50% faster now

* **Improved calculation stability**  
    More stable and faster convergence achieved by changes in the coupling of electromagnetic and thermal solvers 

## v2018.7.2 (April 15, 2019)
* **Instalation of third-party programs made easier**  

## v2018.7.1 (March 20, 2019)
* **Added hardening profiles**  
    View 2D or 3D hardening profiles via new ParaView filters. [**Read more**](/results#hardened-zone)

## v2018.7.0 (February 12, 2019)

* **NEW feature: Simulate induction with scanning**  
    Simulation of the process when a workpiece or an inductor is moving, i.e., scanning, is possible now. [**Read more**](/scanning)

* **NEW feature: Run multiple simulations in batch**  
    Prepare multiple simulation cases and run them one after another automatically. Leave your computer to do the job at night. [**Read more**](/batch-running)

## v2018.6.6 (January 7, 2019)

* **Fixed properties of “Medium carbon steel 1045”**  
    If you have used it in your projects, reselect it and redo calculations.

* **Fixed several stability issues**

## v2018.6.5 (December 4, 2018)

* **Faster post-processing**  
    For small to medium-size cases, the post-processing routine, which previously occurred after the calculation was done, now occurs simultaneously during the simulation. This significantly reduces the post-processing routine time.

* **View results of calculated time steps also if simulation has been stopped**

* **Added “Magnetic Energy” values column in the post-processing results file**  
    These values are needed for coil inductance calculation.

* **Added depth parameter for 2D planar simulation**  
    Integral quantities in 2D planar case are now calculated relative to the depth.

* **Report an issue directly from Cenos software**
