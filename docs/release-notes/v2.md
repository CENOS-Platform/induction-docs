  your domain, e.g., workpiece, inductor or air.
* **New: Thermal simulation of Stranded Coils**  
* **Improved: Results in ParaView**  
  Temperature in the inductor will be displayed by default if Thermal Analysis 
  is enabled in it.
* **Improved: Preview window in Physics**  
  Jump to a specific domain by clicking on it in the preview window. Hovering on
  boundary reveals it in the list, and vice versa ('From CAD' only).
* Fix: Time steps were missing if ParaView was opened with saved state file
* Fix: Surface Impedance boundary condition
* Fix: Adjusted and corrected B(H) behaviour
* Fix: Scanning-related error

* **Slice angle**      
  When geometry is a 3D slice, enter its angle for automatic calculation of
  mean values 
* **Choosing post-values**  
  It is possible to check/uncheck, which additional values to obtain after
  calculation finishes, e.g, Joule heat, active power, permeability. Disabling
  unnecessary values reduces overall time of simulation. Click the gear icon
  on the Visualisation block to configure.

## v2.1 (September 30, 2019)
* **Required: Salome 9 &ndash; simpler geometry creation**  
  A new module called *Shaper* has been added 
  which is an alternative of the existing GEOM module, but with a much simpler geometry creation process.

  When working in the "From CAD" workflow, boundary selection is a way faster
  and possible also by clicking on the preview area 
* **Fix: Unphysical results after merging in "From CAD" view**    
  In some situations, merging domains or boundaries inside the "From CAD" view
  led to unphysical calculation results
