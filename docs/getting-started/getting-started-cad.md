You can import premade CAD files and prepare geometry for simulation directly into CENOS.

**Generate an air box and mesh automatically**, and set up the simulation without the need for manual geometry or mesh editing.

## Select the geometry-building approach

To import premade CAD files, click **From CAD** in the CENOS home window.

### Create an Air Box

 Create an air box **automatically**.

<p align="center">

</p>

**Select the inductor terminals** as references for the air box size and click on *create air*.

### Prepare volumes

**IMPORTANT**: To make volume and surface selection and preparation easier, the *From CAD* feature includes multiple useful tools.

<p align="center">

</p>

 + **Select all** - Selects all volumes or boundaries available for selection.
 
 + **Show all** - Turns the object visibility on or off.
 
 + **Merge** - Merge or *group* multiple volumes or surfaces into one.
 
 + **Unmerge** - Split previously merged or *grouped* objects into their initial state.

**Group and rename the volume domains** as needed.

### Prepare boundaries

Click on **Workpice surface**, where you will select the faces that will serve as boundary conditions for the analysis, you can also filter the faces by volume, to make selection easier.

Finally, add as many roles as your system require such as **extra workpieces**, **extra inductors and their terminals**, **flux concentrators**, **air** and *others*.

</p>

After setting the geometry, click on **GO TO PHYSICS** to enter physics setup.

## Define simulation parameters

### Enter physical parameters

In the SIMULATION CONTROL window **define global parameters** such as *frequency*, *calculation time* etc.

<p align="center">

</p>

In the SIMULATION DOMAIN windows such as "WORKPIECE" **define the physical parameters and boundaries of each domain** such as *material*, *heat exchange*, *current*, etc.

<p align="center">

</p>

In the inductor section, you will be able to input either ***voltage***, ***current*** or ***power***

</p>

## Meshing

CENOS has an integrated mesh builder, after setting up the physics, click **GO TO MESH** to enter physics setup.

<p align="center">

![From CAD](assets/cad/mesh0.png)
 
</p>

Select how dense you want the automatic mesh to be 
 
<p align="center">

</p>

In case you want to make any changes to the mesh generated by our algorithm you can do it by enabling the ***mesh refinement*** and selecting the element you'd like to adjust

<p align="center">

![From CAD](assets/cad/mesh2.png)

</p>

From there, you will be able to disble the automatic skin layer calculator and refine the whole section, or faces and edges, according to your needs.

## Post-processing

In the end of the calculation the post-processing tool *ParaView* will automatically **open with a pre-set temperature state**, and you will be able to see the **temperature field distribution** in the workpiece on the last time step.

### Integral values

For integral values such as **apparent power, induced heat and complex voltage** you can use the .csv file, which is generated along with the visual results. You can access it through the *Note* button next to the *Visualization* block *Play* button.
